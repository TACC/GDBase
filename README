GDBase
======

GDBase is an open source offline parallel debugger designed for scalable execution
and flexible analysis. The debugger works by collecting user-specified data during
the execution of a job and storing it in a database, which is available for offline
inspection.

GDBase decouples execution and analysis, and provides the means of data mining
the collected data for faults in the code. This version is a proof-of-concept 
prototype. 

For further details refer to the documentation in the docs directory.
