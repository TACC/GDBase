Installation
============

GDBase relies on:

* gdb-6.8				http://sourceware.org/gdb/
* sqlite-3.5.9			http://www.sqlite.org/
* tcl-8.4.19			http://www.tcl.tk/
* postgresql-8.3.3		http://www.postgresql.org/
* Python-2.5.2			http://www.python.org/
* PyGreSQL-3.8.1		http://www.druid.net/pygresql/

The versions listed above have been tested with GDBase but earlier versions 
will likely work as well. If you have these installed already you're all
set. The recommended installation procedure is:

    ./configure --prefix=</FullPathToInstallDir> --with-tcl=<version>
	make
	make install

If you plan on using the postgres database to collect your debugging
information you will need to config gdbase for your server. Create a file with 
the following:

	dbname=opd host=localhost port=5432 user=postgres password=mypassword

Then specify that file on the command line when executing gdbase:

	gdbase --config ./myconfig

Change the information to match your needs. An example file is located in 
db/db.config. For further details on the database setup please refer to the 
GDBase User Guide.
